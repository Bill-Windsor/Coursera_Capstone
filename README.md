# IBM Data Science Professional Certification: Capstone Project

In this final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification, we are chartered to generate a business decision, then to construct a business decision framework to evaluate the business decision with machine learning and other data science and mathematics methods. A portion of the business decision is required to utilize geographical venues information in the Foursquare API and dataset.

In this project I evaluate the business decision: Where Should I Locate a Professional Services Business, choosing between San Francisco in the SoMa District (South of Market Street), or Seattle in the Pioneer Square district?

IBM Data Science Professional Certification - Capstone Project
In this final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification, we are chartered to generate a business decision, and then to construct a business decision framework to evaluate the business decision with machine learning and other data science and mathematics methods. A portion of the business decision is required to utilize geographical venues information in the Foursquare API and dataset. 
In this project I evaluate the business decision: Where Should I Locate a Professional Services Business, choosing between San Francisco in the SoMa District (South of Market Street), or Seattle in the Pioneer Square district?
The Python Jupyter Notebook for this project is located at:
